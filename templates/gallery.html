    <h1>Keywordcounter Sample Output</h1>
    <p>This bar charts are samples of keywordcounter.com's outputs for a given
    job search on indeed.com by <i>title</i>.

    In this case, <b><i>digital marketing</i></b>.

    <p>The first you'll see is an analysis of keyword pairs. The program
    searches the job postings for bullet points and gathers all the text in
    those points. Then the text is analyzed for common word pairs. Pairs which
    occur too often or not few times, are not considered.</p>

    <p><img src='/static/digital_marketing.png' alt="keyword pairs from analysis of jobs"></p>

    <p>This analysis is similar to the one above, except the words are not pairs but
    single words. Also, the words have been reduced to their "stems" before analysis.
    This is helpful, because now words like:
    <li>work</li>
    <li>worked</li>
    <li>working</li>

    <p>Are grouped as the same word.</p>

    <p><img src='/static/digital_marketing_monograms.png' alt="single keywords
    from analysis of jobs"></p>

    <p>It's often helpful to know which job titles were found, especially if you are
    searching by <i><b>keyword</b></i> rather than <i><b>title</b></i>.</p>
